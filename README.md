Wireshark &amp; Risk Analysis

This project dives into using Wireshark for network security, focusing on spotting and tackling a SYN flood attack. Wireshark, a top tool for network analysis, captures and inspects network traffic, crucial for spotting security threats. The project identified a SYN flood attack, a nasty move that bombards a network, aiming to disrupt operations.

The response? Risk mitigation. This means beefing up network defenses and running regular tests to find weak spots. Despite these efforts, there's always a leftover riskâ€”new attack methods or internal limits could still pose a threat. The bottom line is staying vigilant, updating security strategies, and being ready to adapt to new cyber challenges. This isn't just about tech; it's about safeguarding the institution's reputation and ensuring smooth operations, crucial for academic settings where network reliance is high for teaching, research, and communication.
